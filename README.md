# InsiderThreatAnalysis
InsiderThreatAnalysis is an open-source toolkit to detect malicious developer behavior using heuristics like commit history, timing anomalies, and time-tracking mismatches. Assign risk scores to developers, flag suspicious activity, and prevent code sabotage or data leaks.

## ðŸš€ Features  
- **Risk Scoring**: Quantify developer risk (0â€“100) based on:  
  - Code churn, commit frequency, and static analysis flags.  
  - Off-hour commits and rapid commit clusters.  
  - Mismatches between logged hours and actual Git activity.  
- **Automated Alerts**: Slack/Jira notifications for high-risk scores.  
- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping**: Link behaviors to known tactics (e.g., T1195).  
- **CI/CD Ready**: GitHub Actions and GitLab CI integration.
